# TechTitans-Vendorlution

## PROJECT OVERVIEW
Vendorlution is a secure, student-centric online marketplace web application developed to streamline local buying and selling. Inspired by platforms like Facebook Marketplace and WhatsApp commerce—but built to address their limitations.

This application is not a delivery network but instead allows buyers and sellers to coordinate delivery or meetups themselves, promoting flexibility and user control. It encourages local economic participation and social accountability in digital commerce spaces.

# TARGET AUDIENCE
Buyers – Students and individuals looking to purchase items from verified sellers securely.

Sellers – Small businesses, artisans, and local vendors wanting to showcase and sell their products to a trusted university-based community.
